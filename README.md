# What is this?

I'm making a website for my wife, which started as a template from some website, but I was completely dissatisified with the over-the-top use of jQuery for things css was able to do.


# Here's how you do stuff

## Get any updates:

```bash
git pull origin master
```

## Run the local server to do live editting before you deploy:

```bash
yarn dev
```

The local server will be: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## Upload your changes to github:

```bash
git commit -am "Change this text to describe what you changed."
git push origin master
```

## Deploy to your domain:

```bash
yarn deploy
```
