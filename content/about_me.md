# About Me

I am a soon to be graduate of Wilfrid Laurier University - and am in the process of applying to graduate school -
with the hopes of entering a Clinical Psychology (or related) field.  I have been married to my wonderful software-developer husband
since 2011, and we are the loving owners of a retired service dog, named Harley, from the National Service Dogs Charity.


# Research Interests

My research interests are varied and tend to change over time, but I am currently interested in: high functioning autism, the female autism phenotype, abnormal psychology,
personal identity formation, psychopathology, psychometrics, the 'Dark Triad', Borderline Personality Disorder (in males), and topics relating to forensic psychology
(e.g., false testimony, memory, malingering, etc.).


# Academic Highlights
