## ABOUT ME 
I recently graduated with a Master of Arts in Psychology with high distinction. Previously, I graduated with an Honours Bachelor of Arts in Psychology (Concentration: Research Specialist), with a Minor in Philosophy. I am currently pursuing a career in research or in a related field  (e.g., article editing).

My [husband](https://www.mrbarry.com/), a software developer, and I have been married for 8 years. We recently purchased our first home and have been enjoying living in the country with our 2 dogs, Harley and Rufus.

Thank you for visiting my professional website! I am interested in all opportunities that present themselves to me, so feel free to reach out if you'd like!
