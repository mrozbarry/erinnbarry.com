Up to this point, my research has focused on personal identity formation (i.e., Marcia) and aspects of the proposed female autism phenotype. I am also interested in psychopathology, psychometrics, abnormal behaviour, personality, terror management theory, and topics relating to forensic psychology (e.g., false testimony, memory, malingering, etc.).
