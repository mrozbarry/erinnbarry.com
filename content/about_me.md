## ABOUT ME 
I graduated with a Master of Arts degree in Psychology (thesis based) in 2019. Previously, I graduated with an Honours Bachelor of Arts degree in Psychology (Concentration: Research Specialist), with a Minor in Philosophy. 

Currently, I am working as a contract editor at Cactus Communications, editing manuscripts in psychology and psychosocial healthcare.

My [husband](https://www.mrbarry.com/), a software developer, and I have been married since 2011. We recently purchased our first home and have been enjoying living in the country with our 2 dogs, Harley and Rufus.

Thank you for visiting my professional website! I am interested in all opportunities that present themselves to me (particularly those that are research related), so feel free to reach out if you'd like!
