# About Me

I will soon be graduating with an Honours BA from Wilfrid Laurier University, and am currently in the process of applying to graduate school. I hope to enter a Clinical Psychology (or related) field, with an emphasis on psychology research. I have been married to my wonderful husband, a [software developer](http://mrbarry.com), since 2011. We are the loving owners of a retired service dog, named Harley, from the National Service Dogs Charity. In my spare time, I enjoy playing the piano, particularly the works of Chopin and Rachmaninoff. If you wish, you may visit my personal YouTube page (see above for the link) for various piano related videos.  <br/>


# Research Interests

My research interests are varied and tend to change over time, but I am currently interested in: high functioning autism, the female autism phenotype, abnormal psychology, personal identity formation, psychopathology, psychometrics, the 'Dark Triad', Borderline Personality Disorder (in males), and topics relating to forensic psychology (e.g., false testimony, memory, malingering, etc.). <br/>


# Academic Highlights

 - I was recently awarded the Women in Science: Hypatia Award for my undergraduate research project, valued at $500 (summer 2017). 

 - Previously, I was awarded an NSERC Undergraduate Student Research Assistantship (USRA), valued at $5,625 (summer 2015).

 - I was top of my CP102 (Information Processing with Microcomputer Systems) class of over 800 students, with an average of 100% (winter 2014). 

 - During my time at Laurier, I have been involved in a handful of presentations, and am the co-author of 1 research article that is currently in review.
