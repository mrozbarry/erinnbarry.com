## About Me

I will be graduating with an Honours BA in Psychology (Research Specialist) from Wilfrid Laurier University (WLU) in June 2018, and will be pursuing an MA in Developmental Psychology in September 2018 (also at WLU). I am particularly interested in cognitive and behavioural assessment procedures, and hope to enter a related career field.

<br> Thank you to my wonderful [husband](http://mrbarry.com) for helping me create this website! Alex and I have been married since 2011, and are the loving owners of a retired service dog, named Harley. In my spare time, I enjoy playing the piano, reading, and experimenting with photography. If you wish, you may visit my personal YouTube page (see above for the link) for various piano related videos.  <br/>

# Research Interests

My research interests are varied and tend to change over time, but I am currently interested in: resilience, high functioning autism (i.e., Asperger's Syndrome), the proposed female autism phenotype, personal identity formation, psychopathology, psychometrics, Borderline Personality Disorder (in males), eating disorders, terror management theory, and topics relating to forensic psychology (e.g., false testimony, memory, malingering, etc.). 

If you are interested, I recently conducted a study examining personal identity formation in individuals diagnosed with (or self-identify as having) an Autism Spectrum Disorder. Participants received [this brief report](/EB-Report-Vs3.pdf). <br/>
