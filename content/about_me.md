## ABOUT ME 
I recently graduated with an Honours BA in Psychology (Research Specialist) (with high distinction) from Wilfrid Laurier University (WLU), and am currently pursuing an MA in Developmental Psychology also at WLU. Up to this point, under the supervision of [Dr. Nicky Newton](http://pandalab.ca), my honours research has focused primarily on personal identity formation and the proposed female autism phenotype. 

<br> Thank you to my wonderful [husband](http://mrbarry.com) for helping me create this website! Alex and I have been married since 2011, and are the loving owners of a retired service dog, named Harley. In my spare time, I enjoy playing the piano, reading, and experimenting with photography. If you wish, you may visit my personal YouTube page (see above for the link) for various piano related videos.  <br/>

# RESEARCH INTERESTS
My research interests are varied and tend to change over time, but I am currently interested in: high functioning autism (i.e., Asperger's Syndrome), the proposed female autism phenotype, personal identity formation (e.g., Marcia, Erikson, etc.) , psychopathology, psychometrics, abnormal behaviour, terror management theory, and topics relating to forensic psychology (e.g., false testimony, memory, malingering, etc.).
